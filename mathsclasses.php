							<b>Our Features</b><br/>
Results Oriented Lessons: We only have one goal, to help your child score their best for their exams. Every single lesson is
designed for maximum effect to help our students ACE their exams.<br/>
Proprietary Notes: We know that students today are very busy with school activities, which is why we designed summary notes with
key points of every chapter. Did we mention they are also full colour and no other centre has them? Students learn faster and absorb
better with these notes!

								<h3 class="color-4">1. Class Size</h3>
								
								<p>Why is class size important? With a smaller class, students will find it easier to get their questions answered, and teachers will be able to cater to each student’s
individual needs more easily. In other words, a smaller class size means that your child will receive more individual attention, and hence experience a more
conducive learning environment. In large classrooms, there is frustration for both sides. For teachers, it is in the form of managing such a large group, and for
students, it is in the form of getting their individual doubts cleared. A small class size mitigates these two issues and ensures that your child will experience more
effective tuition!</p>

								<h3 class="color-4">2. Tutor’s Background</h3>
								
								<p>Next up, we will want to look at the tutor’s background. For the most part, you’ll find that teachers and ex-teachers will be the most effective tutors, given their
professional training in teaching. An ex-teacher has the industry experience and ‘feel’ that other tutors may lack. Furthermore, experienced tutors will be more
able to impart knowledge quickly and efficiently. And what’s more, we all want to predict examination questions correctly. Well, an ex-teacher, being more
intimate with the education industry, will be able to better predict and spot questions! All in all, the tutor’s background is a very important point to consider when
choosing a tuition centre.</p>

								<h3 class="color-4">3. Testimonials
</h3>
								
								<p>A tuition centre may provide you for information that looks good on paper, and that’s great. However, what we’re really interested in is whether they can actually
deliver! This is where testimonials come into play. What better way to learn of a centre’s effectiveness than to read what other parents/students have to say about
it? In this way, we learn about the tuition centre’s perks. These are specific attributes that make parents/students satisfied with the service. A good resume is
great in theory, but knowing that the centre is able to perform in practice is even better!

								<h3 class="color-4">4. Tutor’s Ability to Connect with Students
</h3>
								
								<p>This is not something that’s easy to spot at first glance! (That’s also why testimonials are important! They show the relationship between tutors and students.) A
truly good tutor doesn’t simply teach, he/she also connects with his students! He motivates them and cheers them on. There is no limit to what a student can
achieve if he has someone rooting for them and pushing them on along the way! A good ability to connect builds trust and confidence, helping student and
teacher to work in tandem as an effective team. Indeed, the benefits of having a tutor that can truly touch the hearts of students are immense.</p>

								<h3 class="color-4">5. Type of Notes</h3>
								
								<p>In choosing a tuition centre, it’s also good to know what type of notes will be issued. Are they made personally by the tutors? Are they specific to that particular
tuition centre? In general, notes that are self-made tend to be of a higher quality. Not only that, since they are likely to only be circulated within the tuition centre
itself, they will give your child an extra edge! After all, he/she will have notes that other students don’t!</p>

								<h3 class="color-4">6. Teaching Style
</h3>
								
								<p>Our children have 3 main learning styles: visual, auditory and kinaesthetic. In learning what your child’s learning style is, you will be more able to pick the tuition
centre that fits your child’s needs best. For instance, if your child is a kinaesthetic learner, he may prefer more hands-on activities. If your child is a visual learner,
he may prefer visual tools such as infographics, animations, videos, etc. And if your child is an auditory learner, he will benefit greatly from a tutor that can
verbalise and explain concepts clearly! A great tuition centre usually has all these covered, so that each and every child will benefit no matter what the learning
style! Also, the visual learning style is the most common one, so it should be your first focus!</p>

								<h3 class="color-4">7. Your Child’s Needs + How the Tuition Centre Addresses Those Needs
</h3>
								
								<p>Finally, we come to perhaps the most important point: knowing your child’s specific needs. A tuition centre may be great, but if it
doesn’t fit your child’s needs, then it is pointless! To truly pick the right centre, we need to know the areas where our kids will need
specific help in. A good tuition centre will have tutors that understand how to tackle your child’s specific problems and create a custom
teaching experience that will suit your child best. The ability to pinpoint the exact point of contention and address it accordingly. This is
one of those traits that truly separates the wheat from the chaff when it comes to tuition!</p>
