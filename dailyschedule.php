down chairs from the table, placing rug pieces on the 
floor for Circle Time, preparing the snack for the day, 
setting up art projects and developmental skill areas on 
the tables, turning on the computer, preparing 
sanitizing solution and washing hands for the day. </p>

										<p>Arrival - Families are welcomed to the preschool. The teachers greet the children and 
encourage them to hang up their coat and backpack in their locker and then help them 
transition to a free play activity. We suggest that parents or caregivers only stay a few 
minutes to say goodbye. Families are encouraged to have their child arrive by 9:00 AM. </p>

										<p>Free Play – Free play provides opportunities for learning and social interaction. Self
directed centers of interest are set up to allow children to independently choose activities 
that help them separate and adjust to the beginning of the day. </p>

										<p>Circle Time – Circle Time is a more structured setting where children are asked to practice 
self-regulation, increase attention span, and develop listening skills. The children greet one 
another, record the weather, mark the calendar, sing songs, listen to stories, practice finger 
plays, and talk about what they would like to learn that day. We encourage children to take 
turns talking and listening to each other.

										<p>Clean Up/Snack/Health – Children share the responsibility of cleaning up the preschool. 
Self-help skills such as independent toileting, washing hands, pouring juice, and rinsing cups 
are encouraged. Snack is also a social time where children learn table manners and visit 
with each other and the teachers. Healthy eating is promoted and a variety of nutritional 
foods are a part of snack-time.

										<p>Outside Play & Creative Movement – We use the playground outside the preschool 
whenever possible. Children develop their large motor and social skills during outside play. 
A climbing structure, swings, sliding board, tricycles, balls, scooters and a child sized 
playhouse are included in the playground equipment. The M/W/F class walks to the 
college’s Old ’77 gym on Wednesdays for creative movement sessions during the winter 
months.

										<p>Dismissal – Departure is the closing routine of a busy day. The children sing the “Good-bye 
Song”, practice self-help skills by putting on their coats, and gathering projects or 
information to be taken home. The parent or caregiver is asked to enter the classroom to pick-up their child.
